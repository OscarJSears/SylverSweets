I kept my wireframe very basic so that the person viewing the website can focus on the structure of the website instead of the look.
At the top left of the website it will have the name and logo.
The squares you see on the top right is the menu and they follow you throughout the entire website. The Home button will take you back to home page when pressed even when on another part of the website will take you back to the home page.
The Cake button will take you to a page where you can view all the Cake products.
The About button will take you to a page that will have what our views are.
The last square is the Cart button that will take you to your shopping cart.
Below that is a huge button that will display our new cakes. It will rotate through the new products in intervals of 10 seconds.
Below that on the left is the Cake all that does the same as the Cake menu button.
As well as, the About Us that does the exact same as the About menu button.
Below all that is the Contact Us. This will allow the customer to leave a review or just contact us for any assistance needed.
